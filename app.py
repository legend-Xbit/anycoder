WEBSITE REDESIGN - EXTRACTION FAILED
====================================

ERROR: Could not extract meaningful HTML content from this website. This could be due to:
1. The website uses heavy JavaScript to load content dynamically
2. The website has anti-bot protection
3. The website requires authentication
4. The website is using advanced compression or encoding

FALLBACK APPROACH:
Please create a modern, responsive website design for a {title_text.lower()} website. Since I couldn't extract the original content, you can:

1. Create a typical layout for this type of website
2. Use placeholder content that would be appropriate
3. Include modern design elements and responsive features
4. Use a clean, professional design with good typography
5. Make it mobile-friendly and accessible

PAGE ANALYSIS:
- This appears to be a {title_text.lower()} website

ORIGINAL HTML CODE (use this as the base for redesign):
```html

REDESIGN INSTRUCTIONS:
Please redesign this website with a modern, responsive layout while:
1. Preserving all the original content and structure
2. Maintaining the same navigation and functionality
3. Using the original images and their URLs (listed above)
4. Creating a modern, clean design with improved typography and spacing
5. Making it fully responsive for mobile devices
6. Using modern CSS frameworks and best practices
7. Keeping the same semantic structure but with enhanced styling

IMPORTANT: All image URLs in the HTML code above have been converted to absolute URLs and are ready to use. Make sure to preserve these exact image URLs in your redesigned version.
